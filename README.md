# AI Act is here, there is time to explain, get into the car. 
Repository with code presented during the workshop at the Perspektywy Women in Tech Summit 2024. 

Link to [Bank Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravtopre/bank-customer-churn-dataset) used in these notebooks.

We present 4 notebooks:
- [01_EDA](https://github.com/MarBry111/wit_2024_xai/blob/main/01_EDA.ipynb) - as name suggests simple Exploratory Data Analysis of selected dataset, looking at classes distributions
- [02_train_simple_models](https://github.com/MarBry111/wit_2024_xai/blob/main/02_train_simple_models.ipynb) - with training of Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Classifier - and explanations for each of them,
- [03_LIME](https://github.com/MarBry111/wit_2024_xai/blob/main/03_LIME.ipynb) - moving to the black box models (XGBoost) and how to explain them, first solution to this problem using LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations),
- [04_SHAP](https://github.com/MarBry111/wit_2024_xai/blob/main/04_SHAP.ipynb) - and last but not least the notebook with SHAP values, how to compute them, having many useful visualizations which are helpful for model decision understanding.
